# TPLink-Archer
Command-line tool to get TPLink Archer router configuration.

I created this tool to solve an issue with my TPLink Archer MR600 router and now I find it useful to
get various information from it w/o using the  web interface.
Basically, it can be used to get the configuration information available on the main page on the
web interface, e.g.: ISP, Network configuration, DNS information, usage statistics, HW/SW version,...
